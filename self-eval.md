# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It is challenging not knowing if I am going in the right direction or not. Sometimes feel confused how to use what I know and what hints I'm finding and how to put those together to get what I want.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Workflow is going well. If I hit a road block and I can't find an answer within ~10 min I take a small break and try again.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
Need help with how to google to find answers.
